        <p>Known as the “River of No Return” by early explorers, the Salmon is a big mountain river. It has big water with spring flows rivaling that of Colorado’s Grand Canyon and big, fun, roller-coaster style rapids; a big, incredibly beautiful, river corridor set in a massive wilderness with peaks rising over a mile above the river; huge sandy beaches shaded by towering pine and fir trees; big side creeks full of trout (creeks that would be called rivers in many parts of the world); a long history full of big personalities, characters, and stories; a ton of wildlife including Big Horn Sheep, Black Bear, and Bald Eagle; and most importantly it offers an authentic wilderness experience.</p>
        <p>However, despite its size, history, remoteness, and ominous-sounding nickname, the Salmon River is incredibly friendly and comfortable. It features warm summer days lasting until nearly 10 in the evening, cool nights perfect for sleeping under the stars, water perfect for swimming, natural hot springs to soak in, perhaps the best beach camping anywhere, world-class trout fishing, a ton of hiking, and whitewater that is exciting yet safe. People have said that it feels wild, untouched, and rugged but, at the same time, comfortable, forgiving, and almost luxurious – a journey that combines a perfect beach vacation with the solitude, beauty, vast wilderness, and excitement of a mountain whitewater river expedition.</p>

        <h3>Rapids Rafting</h3>

        <p>The River of No Return is one of those rare river trips that is ideal for the seasoned whitewater connoisseur, someone wanting to make the jump from shorter wilderness trips like Oregon’s Rogue River, or for first timers looking for their first river trip or an amazing vacation. The trip can be enjoyed by those wanting high adventure, those wanting a very active trip, and those just wanting a beautiful, lazy vacation. Our salmon trips range from groups of families to college buddies to chartered private trips and it is not uncommon to have trips enjoyed by three generations of family or friends.</p>
        <p>The whitewater features big water wave trains punctuated by calm green pools. It is fun and exciting, but great for almost any age level. You have the choice of sitting in relaxing oar boats, participating in more exciting paddle boats, or navigating the whitewater in an inflatable kayak or a stand up paddle board (this adds a big level of excitement to the rapids).</p>

        <p>This incredible wilderness stretch of river is a great place for beginner and intermediate kayakers to develop both river running and play-boating skills. Over the course of 6 days and 80 miles, Wet Planet instructors will work with you to improve skills and provide constant support. Rafts will support the trip by carrying all personal gear, food and camping equipment, allowing you to focus on the incredible experience of an Idaho multi-day kayaking course.</p>
        <p>Transport yourself into the mountains and true wilderness of Idaho’s Main Salmon River, where big water splashes, warm sandy beaches, and rugged scenery fill your multi-day kayaking expedition. The Main Salmon River weaves a story of early explorers, deep wilderness, and a free-flowing river for an amazing 6 days of paddling. Flowing through Idaho’s Frank Church River of No Return wilderness area, the largest tract of protected wild landscape in the lower 48 states, the Main Salmon’s class III big water rapids and sandy beaches provide an escape for any kind of adventure seeker.</p>
