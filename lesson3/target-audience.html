      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The sites target audience will be focused towards people whos work is effected by streaks of weather.  
        People like farmers can benefit from knowing how long its been since the last almost as much as they can from know when the next rain may come.  
        These thing effect when to plant and when to harvest.  
        People in pest control are similarly effected by weather patterns.  
        The amount of time since the last rain fall and the next can effect what thier treaments look like.
        They will use different chemicals, in different forms, in different locations depending on weather patterns and expected pest infestations.
