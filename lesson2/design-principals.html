                        <p>The web site Medium makes extensive use of alignment to improve readability and navigation.  The main navigation menu is vertically aligned and horizontally scrolling. It allows the user to find and navigate through the site topics quickly.</p>  
                        <p>The frames for each article also use horizontal alignment throughout. The descriptive text is left-aligned on the left side of each article, making it easy to find the information.  The image representing the article is right-aligned on the right side of the frame.  The bookmarks to mark the article as interesting for later reading are center-aligned to the left of the images.</p>
                        <p>This extensive use of alignment makes it very easy to find relevant information and use the site.</p>

                        <p>The web site for Fox News uses visual hierarchy to draw the user to the more prominent parts of the site first.  Their biggest most recent article is always the most prominently displayed item on the page.  The idea that it is what initially brought the user to the site or that it is most like to keep them on the site do to interest.  It always has a large image taking almost a third of the page on a mobile device with a caption in large font.  Immediately under the image is the article summary with an equally large font.  Together this single article takes about two-fifths of the page on a mobile device.</p>
                        <p>The second level of priority occurs at the top of the web page.  It starts with the company name, self-advertising.  The name is followed by two functions in the form of buttons “Login” and “Watch TV.” These are money makers for the site and are displayed prominently.  The remaining news articles on the topic use a much smaller font with the assumption that at this point, the site has the user's attention.</p>

                    <div><p>The web site for BBC uses repetition to good effect on its home page.  The site lists its recent articals in a repeating manner that quickly indicates to the user what to expect from each one.  Each article frame has three core elements.  It has an abbreviated summary of the contents of the article.  It has a theme describing the format or subject of the article such as football or pictures.  It has a small horizontal bar to indicate the category of the news article like Sports in yellow or News in red.  The only exception to this is an occasion image filling the frame, which ends up acting as an accent.</p></div>
